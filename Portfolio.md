The game will use arrow keys as the primary user input for hitting notes during gameplay, while mouse clicks will be utilised for navigate the main interface, including the splash screen, settings, and other menu options. 

**Processing**:  
In gameplay, the system will compare the timing of each arrow key pressed to the expected timing of the note. Based on the accuracy, it will count and categorise the result as "Perfect", "Good", "Bad" or "Miss". 

When the game settings (note speed, music) are changed, the output will be adjusted accordingly.

**Outputs**:  
During gameplay, the system will provide real time feedback , presenting the accuracy of each note at the bottom of the screen. Upon completion of a song, a summary page will display the total number of each rating category and the user's overall accuracy as a percentage. 

The game settings will appear as bars and change colour when selected.
